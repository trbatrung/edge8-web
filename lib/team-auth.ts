// Server-only auth gate for the /team self-service portal. The mirror of
// lib/admin-auth.ts, but for employees and managers instead of admins.
//
// SECURITY MODEL (see docs/plans/2026-07-05-team-portal-design.md):
// company_os has RLS enabled with NO policies and NO grants to the browser key,
// so the publishable key can read nothing there. All /team data goes through the
// service-role client (lib/supabase.ts) exactly like /admin. This gate is the
// ONLY boundary, so every /team page and server action must call
// requireTeamMember() first AND scope every query to the actor's own ids (use
// lib/team/data.ts). Identity is matched on people.auth_user_id (the cryptographic
// id from the JWT), NEVER on email, which is mutable/reusable.
