## How to use this index

- New to the project? Read [`product/product.md`](./product/product.md), then [`product/01-product-timeline.md`](./product/01-product-timeline.md), then come back here.
- Looking for current status? Open [`project-status.html`](./project-status.html) in a browser, or read [`product/epic-status.md`](./product/epic-status.md).
- Starting work on a feature? Read [`features/README.md`](./features/README.md) for the convention before creating files.
- Adding architecture material? Read [`architecture/README.md`](./architecture/README.md) — and ask whether it's really architecture vs. a feature design.
